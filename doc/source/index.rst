Welcome to Neutron Lib documentation!
=====================================

Neutron-lib is an OpenStack library project used by Neutron, Advanced Services,
and third-party projects that aims to provide common functionality across all
such consumers. The library is developed with the following goals in mind:

- Decouple sub-projects from Neutron (i.e. no direct neutron imports in
  sub-projects).
- Pay down Neutron technical debt via refactoring/re-architecting of
  sub-optimal patterns in their respective neutron-lib implementation.

This document describes the library for contributors of the project, and assumes
that you are already familiar with Neutron from an end-user perspective. If not,
hop over to the `OpenStack doc site <https://docs.openstack.org/>`__

This documentation is generated by the Sphinx toolkit and lives in the source
tree.  Additional documentation on Neutron and other components of OpenStack
can be found on the `OpenStack wiki`_ and the `Neutron section of the wiki`.
The `Neutron Development wiki`_ is also a good resource for new contributors.
