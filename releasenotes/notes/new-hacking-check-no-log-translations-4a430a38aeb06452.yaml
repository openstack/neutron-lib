features:
  - |
    New ``N537`` hacking check is introduced that enforces no logging message
    translations, in any logging level. The check is enabled by default. Also,
    the ``N533`` hacking check is now removed because it is covered by
    ``N537``.
upgrade:
  - |
    Library consumers may need to adopt their code to new requirements of ``N537`` hacking check,
    removing translation markers from all logging messages. If for some reason
    it doesn't fit the project, consumers can disable the new hacking check
    using ``ignore`` statement in ``flake8`` section of their ``tox.ini`` file,
    or by other means.
