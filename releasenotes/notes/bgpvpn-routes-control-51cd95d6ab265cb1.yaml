    The ``bgpvpn-routes-control`` API extension is introduced to enrich the
    base ``bgpvpn`` extension.  It allows to control BGPVPN connectivity at
    the granularity of a port and the advertisement into a BGPVPN of routes
    corresponding to destination reachable via a given port (static routes,
    BGPVPN route leaking).
