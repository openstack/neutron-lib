    ``CallbacksManager`` can now subscribe cancellable events. By default,
    only ``before_`` and ``precommit_`` events, in case of error, can raise a
    ``CallbackFailure`` exception. Now, if the event is subscribed with
    the flag ``cancellable`` enabled, the ``publish`` method will raise this
    exception if the callback fails and returns an error.
