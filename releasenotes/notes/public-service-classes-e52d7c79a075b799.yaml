features:
  - The ``neutron_lib.api.extensions.ExtensionDescriptor`` class's
    ``get_plugin_interface`` method now formally only supports
    ``neutron_lib.services.base.ServicePluginBase``. This change reflects
    the existing usage by consumers as almost all are returning
    instances of ``ServicePluginBase`` already.
  - The class ``WorkerBase`` is now available and provides the same
    functionality that's provided by
    ``neutron.worker.WorkerSupportServiceMixin``.
