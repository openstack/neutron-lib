features:
  - The ``extra_dhcp_opt`` API extension definition from ``neutron.extensions``
    has been rehomed to ``neutron_lib.api.definitions`` with the same name.
  - A new validator ``validate_any_key_specs_or_none`` has been added for
    the corresponding validation type ``type:list_of_any_key_specs_or_none``.
    This validator can be used to check that a list of dicts match at least 1
    key spec allowing consumers the ability to define multiple formats for
    their validated data.
