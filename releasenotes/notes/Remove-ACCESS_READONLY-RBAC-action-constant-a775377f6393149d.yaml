    Constant ``ACCESS_READONLY`` which represented RBAC action `access as
    readonly` was removed. This constant was added as part of the RFE `Allow
    sharing security groups as read-only
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1875516>`_ but was never fully
    implemented and is not needed anymore.
