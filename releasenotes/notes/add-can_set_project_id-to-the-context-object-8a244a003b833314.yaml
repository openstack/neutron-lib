    New attribute ``can_set_project_id`` is added to the context object. Value of
    this attribute is set based on the API policy rule
    ``context_can_set_project_id`` and should be used in case when there are
    custom roles with granted permission to send project_id in the request body of the
    POST requests to create resources for other projects.
    For example, ``network_admin`` role which should have persmission to create
    networks for all projects in the cloud.
    By default ``context.can_set_project_id`` is granted to no one and only admin and
    service users can send project_id in the request body.
